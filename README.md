# SWHarden-User-Controls
This repository contains a growing collection of custom user controls for .NET (mostly written in C#). Projects are intended to be copy/pasted out of this repository and into whatever project you're working on.

## SplitDirView
A directory/file browser which gets away from using trees and nodes. The advantage is that very little horizontal screen space is required while navigating through very deep folder structures.

## IconGallery
Show a folder of images as a collection of large icons. Single-clicking or double-clicking icons can do things. Right-clicking icons drops a menu to let you copy the path to clipboard or launch the image in explorer.

## ABFbrowseLib
This library provides directory navigation tools like grouping of ABFs into parent/children relationships. 
It also can read contents right out of ABF files to determine things like sweep count and comments. It can
return all this data as a DataGridView DataTable.
